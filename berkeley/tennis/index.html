<p>This page shows the availability of tennis courts in Berkeley, CA today. It is designed to help find a non-reserved court to go play at for free. My server tries to update it every hour.</p>

<p>The data are pulled from court reservation information on the city's <a href="https://ca-berkeley.civicrec.com/CA/berkeley-ca/catalog/index/50900cc08e08223966673cbdc0c1b7e3">recreation website</a> with the following rules:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Any available reservation times are marked as available.</li>
    <li>Other times within the reservation period of the court are marked as unavailable, as it is presumably reserved. (note: I don't know the reservation period of most of the courts)</li>
    <li>Any other times are marked as available</li>
</ul>
The 1hr blocks I show extend 06:00-22:00 as that is when the parks are officially open.
