<h2>Rules</h2>
<p>“Three-player tennis” is a fun way to play tennis with three people. These are the key points:
<ul>
<li>There are three players.
<li>In each game, one player is alone and the other two are a doubles team.
<li>The doubles/singles team and the serve rotate every game.
<li>The player who is alone playes within singles bounds, and the doubles team plays within doubles bounds.
<li>The game scoring is usual (love, 15, 30, 40, game).
<li>Each set is played to 12 points.
<li>Each player has their own score of games won.
<li>Winning a game on the doubles team gives one point each, and winning a game while alone gives two points.
</ul>
Supposing that the players are A, B, and C, here is a cycle we suggest. The vertical line character separates the teams, and the bolded player serves.</p>
<ol>
<li> A | B, <b>C</b>
<li> B | C, <b>A</b>
<li> C | A, <b>B</b>
<li> <b>A</b> | B, C
<li> <b>B</b> | A, C
<li> <b>C</b> | B, A
<li> A | <b>B</b>, C
<li> B | <b>C</b>, A
<li> C | <b>A</b>, B
<li> <b>A</b> | B, C
<li> <b>B</b> | A, C
<li> <b>C</b> | B, A
</ol>
<p>Here is an alternate cycle:</p>
<ol>
<li> A | <b>B</b>, C
<li> B | <b>C</b>, A
<li> C | <b>A</b>, B
<li> A | B, <b>C</b>
<li> B | C, <b>A</b>
<li> C | A, <b>B</b>
<li> <b>A</b> | B, C
<li> <b>B</b> | A, C
<li> <b>C</b> | B, A
<li> <b>A</b> | B, C
<li> <b>B</b> | A, C
<li> <b>C</b> | B, A
</ol>
<p>You can come up with your own cycle as well. We think a good cycle should be easy to remember, and should minimize repetitions.</p>

<h2>About</h2>
<p>Three-player tennis was created in late 2024 by me and my friends Katie and João Vitor. We just wanted to play tennis with three people.</p>
