<h1>Median game</h1>
<!--#include virtual="/header.html"-->
<p>"Median game" is a card game where, in each round, players try to place the card which is the median (hence the name). The objective is to win the most rounds. The game can be played with any number of players â‰¥ 3, though is best played with 3 or 4 players. Below are the rules for an odd number of players.</p>
<p>The game is played with a standard deck of cards. It could in principle be played with a larger or smaller deck. Aces are high. Each player is dealt some number of cards. 5 is a good choice. Increasing the number of cards leads to less round-by-round randomness/luck, and decreasing it leads to more randomness. Players can see their own cards and can't see each other's cards, but can show them if they would like.</p>
<ul>
<li>One player places a card face-down on the table. In the first round, it is the dealer, and in the following rounds, it is whoever most recently won a round.</li>
<li>The other players can discuss however they would like, including with the player who went first.</li>
<li>The other players each place a card face-down on the table.</li>
<li>The cards just played are revealed.</li>
<ul>
    <li>If there is a unique median card (e.g. there are 3 players and cards were 5, 8, J), the player who placed it wins the round, takes all the cards from this round and from the "pool", and sets them face-down in front of themselves.</li>
    <li>In case of a tie (e.g. there are 3 players and the cards were 5, 5, J), the cards just played are set to the side face-down in the "pool".</li>
</ul>
<li>If there are enough cards remaining in the deck for all players to draw one card, all players draw one card.</li>
<li>Repeat the above steps until the players have no cards left.</li>
<li>After all rounds have been played, the player with the most rounds won is the winner. The number of rounds won by players can be checked by looking at how many face-down cards each player has in front of themselves</li>
</ul>
<p>For an even number of players, the rules are the same, except the player going first in each round announces before the round starts whether the winner will be the "high or low median". For example, if there are 4 players, the player going first will announce whether the winner will be the player who places the second-highest or second-lowest card.</p>
