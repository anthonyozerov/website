  <p>I was a member of Columbia University Formula Racing from 2019 to 2021, and did some cool projects at the intersection of computer science, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering. On the team, I was the lead for the wiring harness of our Internal Combustion Engine racecar.</p>

  <p>After a month of hard work, I produced a full schematic of our previously undocumented wiring harness with the help of other members. It was not completely polished, and, with the team's constant prototyping, a full schematic likely never will be! We had recently wired up a pneumatic paddle shifter setup, and I had yet to document the components and dozens of wires.</p>
  <p>I used KiCad to make this schematic. All the files for this schematic are in <a href="/projects/racing/harness">this</a> directory.</p>
