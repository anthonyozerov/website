<p>2024-11-09</p>
<p>According to whatever metrics, the public’s trust in media pretty low
in the US. See this figure <a
href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/651977/americans-trust-media-remains-trend-low.aspx">from
Gallup</a>:</p>
<!-- gallup-media-trust.png -->
<p><img src="gallup-media-trust.png" /></p>
<p>Which bin would you put yourself in? I would put myself under “Not
very much.” Let’s examine why that is. I think there are a few things
that have reduced my trust in the media:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#bias">My perception of media bias</a></li>
<li><a href="#govt">The media being wrong about something concerning
me</a></li>
<li><a href="#visual">Subtle messaging in visual media</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Note: when I say “the media” here, I mean what some refer to as
“traditional media” or “legacy media.” Basically the large corporate
newspapers and cable news. I don’t mean independent media, social media,
etc.</p>
<h2 id="bias-in-reporting"><a  name="bias"></a>Bias in reporting</h2>
<p>According to whatever surveys, many or most Americans think the media
is biased. Some think it biased to the political left, and some think it
biased to the political right. If you define the center as the “average”
or “moderate” US voter, then based on my perception I would say the
media is biased to the left. (But, for exmaple, they may at the same
time be biased to the “right” of California politics). Of course, the
left-right axis is not (and should not be) the only dimension of
political belief, and maybe the media have a right-leaning bias on some
issues.</p>
<p>Since the election has just happened, the top-of-mind example of
media bias for me is election-related. What I’ve noticed is that,
nowadays, when a friend tells me that Donald Trump said something highly
questionable, I don’t believe it unless I see the full context. Of
course, I trust my friends, so why is that?</p>
<p>Given that I trust my friends, this would be the ideal communication
path:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Trump says something</li>
<li>My friend hears him say it</li>
<li>My friend tells me what Trump said</li>
</ol>
<p>I do not have friends who hang out with Trump or watch him much, so
this is not what happens. Instead it is more like this:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Trump says something</li>
<li>The media report on it</li>
<li>My friend sees the media’s reports</li>
<li>My friend tells me what Trump said</li>
</ol>
<p>(In practice, sometimes point 2 is a chain of media reports, and
sometimes point 3 is a chain of people.)</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have lost trust in the accurate reporting of the
media. Or rather, they have lost my trust.</p>
<p>Let’s first examine two examples of a Trump quote, and some
corresponding media headlines.</p>
<ul>
<li>The media examples are both US and international, news and magazine
and tabloid, reputable and non-reputable.</li>
<li>I give the headlines because that is the public’s initial impression
an article, and where the article’s message can be most obvious.</li>
<li>I also give a headline which I think better conveys the context and
what Trump seems to have meant.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can judge for yourself how faithfully the article headlines
represent what Trump means. I think the comparison between the quotes
and the headlines speaks for itself.</p>
<h3 id="the-bloodbath">The bloodbath</h3>
<p>Here is an excerpt from a Trump rally on March 16, 2024 in Dayton,
Ohio.</p>
<p><em>China now is building a couple of massive plants where they’re
going to build the cars in Mexico and think, they think, that they’re
going to sell those cars into the United States with no tax at the
border. Let me tell you something to China, if you’re listening
President Xi, and you and I are friends, but he understands the way I
deal. Those big monster car manufacturing plants that you’re building in
Mexico right now, and you think you’re going to get that, you’re going
to not hire Americans, and you’re going to sell the cars to us?
No. We’re going to put a 100% tariff on every single car that comes
across the line, and you’re not going to be able to sell those cars. If
I get elected. Now, if I don’t get elected, it’s going to be a
bloodbath, for the whole — that’s going to be the least of it. It’s
going to be a bloodbath for the country. That’ll be the least of it. But
they’re not going to sell those cars.</em></p>

<h3 id="the-firing-squad">The firing squad</h3>
<p>Here is an excerpt from an Oct. 31 campaign event. Trump is speaking
to Tucker Carlson and the audience.</p>
<p><em>I don’t want to go to war. (Liz Cheney) wanted to go, she wanted
to stay in Syria. I took (troops) out. She wanted to stay in Iraq. I
took them out. I mean, if were up to her, we’d, we’d be in 50 different
countries. And you know, number one, it’s very dangerous. Number two, a
lot of people get killed. And number three, I mean, it’s very, very
expensive.</em></p>
<p>…</p>
<p><em>I don’t blame (Dick Cheney) for sticking with his daughter, but
his daughter is a very dumb individual, very dumb. She’s a radical war
hawk. Let’s put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels
shooting at her, ok, let’s see how she feels about it, you know, when
the guns are trained on her face. You know they’re all war hawks when
they’re sitting in Washington in a nice building, saying oh gee, we’ll,
let’s send 10,000 troops right into the mouth of the enemy. But she’s a
stupid person. I used to have, I had meetings with a lot of people. She
always wanted to go to war with people.</em></p>

<h3 id="why">Why?</h3>
<p>I fail to see why the journalists writing these articles, the
fact-checkers reviewing them, and the editorial staff approving them,
have chosen this route. Is this a situation for <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon&#39;s_razor">Hanlon’s
razor</a>, that we shouldn’t attribute to malice what can be explained
by stupidity? Is our elite journalist class just bad at reading and
conveying context? Is there a profit incentive to sensationalize Trump
quotes? Or are the journalists, who skew Democratic, exhibiting a bias
and trying to set the narrative?</p>
<p>I don’t know, but it’s hard to see the above and not sense a
bias.</p>
<h3 id="the-consequences">The consequences</h3>
<p>Now, let’s imagine Trump really says something as horrible as these
headlines. Certainly he has a history of saying some horrible things.
Think about what will happen next time:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The media report on it. Whether biased or not, it’s hard to make
what he said more extreme.</li>
<li>Someone only reads the headline or hears about it from someone else.
If they remember the previous incidents where the media have stretched
his quotes, they disregard it or look into it further. How many people
would go seek out the original full video or full quote instead of just
disregarding it?</li>
<li>Trump and his allies deflect questions about what he said by
pointing to previous instances of media bias or “fake news.”</li>
</ol>
<p>Clearly, the consequences are a reduced trust in and reduced
influence of the media, especially when it comes to national politics.
There has certainly been much hand-wringing over the public’s decreasing
trust in the media. But there’s not much we can do about that if these
low levels of trust are justified.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks we will see plenty a think-piece on why Trump won
the 2024 election, and the media’s role in it. I hope they do some
sincere self-reflection. If the media continue on their current path,
it’ll be a bloodbath.</p>
<h2 id="a-personal-experience-with-media-falsehood"><a  name="govt"></a>
A personal experience with media falsehood</h2>
<p>I went to high school at <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-American_School_of_Moscow">an
international school in Russia</a>. In the winter of 2016-2017, while we
were all off on winter break, a diplomatic conflict flared up between
the US (under Obama) and Russia (under Putin). The US expelled 35
Russian diplomats from the country and closed some Russian diplomatic
compounds in the US. Then a <a
href="https://www.cnn.com/2016/12/29/politics/russia-sanctions-announced-by-white-house/"
rel="“nofollow”">CNN article</a> wrote that:</p>
<p><em>Russia’s first visible action came later Thursday, when Russian
authorities ordered the closure of the Anglo-American School of Moscow,
a US official briefed on the matter said. The order from the Russian
government closes the school, which serves children of US, British and
Canadian embassy personnel, to US and foreign nationals.</em></p>
<p>This was, in fact, my school. The article quickly circulated around
the school’s community of expats, diplomats, Russians, and us, their
kids. We were thrown into uncertainty about our academic futures. Where
would we finish the school year? Where would we go? This promised to
tear apart the whole community.</p>
<p>Notably, the article lacked qualifications like “CNN was unable to
independently verify this information.”</p>
<p>Politico quickly <a
href="https://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/russia-american-school-sanctions-233048"
rel="“nofollow”">picked up the story</a> in an article titled “Russia to
close American school, warns of further actions, in wake of U.S.
sanctions”:</p>
<p><em>Russian authorities on Thursday announced the closure of the
Anglo-American School of Moscow, hours after the Kremlin vowed to
retaliate against recent U.S. sanctions.</em></p>
<p><em>The nonprofit day school, which enrolls international students
from pre-kindergarten through 12th grade, will be closed along with the
U.S. Embassy vacation dacha in Serebryany Bor on the outskirts of
Moscow, according to a CNN report.</em></p>
<p>In this report, the word “ordered” turned into “announced,” even
though no such announcement was made, and there is no qualifying
description of CNN’s source.</p>
<p>So anyway, we were stressed and worried about our futures, until our
school announced that it had not been closed, that it would reopen after
winter break, and that everything was as normal. (The school did close a
few years later for reasons not related to this incident)</p>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>An anonymous US government source told CNN that our school was
closing.</li>
<li>CNN reported it as fact, citing the source, and included no
qualifications like “CNN was unable to independently confirm the
information.”</li>
<li>Politico took it at face value, changed “ordered” to “announced,”
and only qualified the information as coming from a CNN report.</li>
<li>Both articles remain unchanged, with no editor’s note, even though
the school did not close.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think we can all agree that steps 3 and 4 are, simply said,
avoidable journalistic mistakes. As someone who lived through the
stress, they were enough to decrease my trust in the media’s ability to
report things carefully and self-correct when proven wrong. But what
happened in 1 and 2? Why was this reported even though our school didn’t
close? Here are some options:</p>
<ul>
<li>CNN made a mistake, misinterpreting what the US official said.</li>
<li>The official made a mistake, misinterpreting some sort of
information.</li>
<li>The official deliberately fed false information that the school was
going to be closed.</li>
<li>Our school was actually going to be closed, but the Russian
government changed its mind.</li>
</ul>
<p>I won’t make a judgment here as to which of these is most likely.
Here is a later <a
href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/12/30/russia-slams-obama-administration-and-cnn-for-lie-that-it-would-shut-american-school-in-moscow/">WaPo
article</a> offering a retrospective and describing the response from
Russia.</p>
<p>Let’s put aside the human effect which the articles’ premature or
false information had on my school’s community. What we should examine
now is the interesting relationship between the government and the media
which let this happen.</p>
<p>Suppose that CNN correctly and honestly interpreted the information
given to them by the US official, and the official made no mistake. Then
there are two cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Russia did in fact order the closure of our school. If known by the
US government, this information would come from either intelligence or
diplomacy, and either way would be considered confidential and probably
not for public disclosure. So a US government official, at their own
initiative or with approval, leaked the information to CNN. It’s not
exactly crucial information which their conscience told them must be
leaked for the American public to know, so why did they leak it?</li>
<li>Russia did not order the closure of our school. So a US government
official, at their own initiative or with approval, lied to CNN. Why did
they do that?</li>
</ul>
<p>In either case, if we examine the motive for leaking true information
or lying, I think the simplest answer is to make Russia look bad for
closing (or planning to close) a school. “Wow, the US expelled
diplomats, and Russia closed a school in response? Who wants to hurt
kids?” This would also perhaps apply diplomatic pressure and prevent
Russia from escalating.</p>
<p>So the outcome of the leak/lie was support for pro-US policy. CNN and
Politico effectively became tools of the government, its mouthpieces in
a diplomatic conflict with Russia.</p>
<p>Is this a desirable situation? I would argue not. We should let the
US promote its interests through explicit means like press releases,
speeches, and so on. The free press should not just be an avenue for
what our leaders want us to think. If you would have disagreed with this
under the Obama or Biden administrations, maybe you’ll agree now. Refer
to Herman and Chomsky’s <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent">Manufacturing
Consent</a> for details on why the media naturally become the voice of
powerful institutions.</p>
<p>So whenever you see an article on foreign policy referring to an
anonymous government source, I invite you to think about the motive.
What does the source say? If the information is important and
embarrassing to the government, it’s probably just a regular leak of
conscience. But sometimes the information will support a pro-government
perspective. Treat such information with care. Note that this can also
apply <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_statement_on_the_Hunter_Biden_emails">when
the sources are not anonymous</a>.</p>
<h2 id="messaging-in-visual-media"><a name="visual"></a> Messaging in
visual media</h2>
<p>I am reminded of another media incident that was quite close to home.
In March 2020, I was in my first year at Columbia when the pandemic
arrived, classes were cancelled, and we were told to pack our bags. Here
is a more specific timeline:</p>
<ul>
<li>March 8: Classes cancelled for March 9-10.</li>
<li>March 9-10: No classes</li>
<li>March 11: Classes resumed online</li>
<li>March 12: Students in dorms encouraged to leave for the rest of the
semester</li>
<li>March 15: Students in dorms able to leave required to leave by March
17</li>
</ul>
<p>March 9-10 was actually a great time. We didn’t expect to have no
class and were grateful for the time off. These days felt more like snow
days (without snow of course) than a dreary lockdown, and many students
spent them outside on the campus’ popular lawns.</p>
<p>So on March 10, I was surprised to see the following in the New York
Times:</p>
<p><img src="nyt-columbia-dining.png" /></p>
<p>The article is <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/nyregion/coronavirus-new-york-update.html"
rel="“nofollow”">here</a>—it has since been slightly updated, though the
image remains. Based on metadata I think the image was taken on March 9.
The current version of that (partly cut-off) text reads:</p>
<p><em>For the thousands of students who attend some of New York City’s
private schools and universities, the list of those closing or canceling
in-person classes grew on Tuesday.</em></p>
<p><em>Columbia University, Fordham University, the New School,
St. John’s University, Yeshiva University and New York University
announced that classes would be canceled or offered online.</em></p>
<p>Here is what I wrote in an email on March 10, 2020:</p>
<p><em>The photo portrays a near-empty dining hall, implying that the
suspension of classes has turned Columbia into some kind of ghost town.
But the vast majority of students are still on-campus and eating in the
dining halls. This photo was almost certainly cherry-picked, either by
the time of day or by the section of the dining hall shown. I was there
earlier today and it didn’t have the desolate or empty vibe that is
portrayed in the photo. Why not, instead, include a photo of Columbia
students having the time of their lives yesterday, hanging out on the
lawn and enjoying the sun and suspended classes? I think accurately
portraying how a community is really doing is important, especially in a
time when we need hope, and not panic.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, the contrast between the photo and the true vibe on campus
was stark. During other parts of the day the dining hall was about as
busy as usual because the complete exodus from campus hadn’t yet begun
(see the timeline above). Students who lived in residence halls were
still there and still using their meal plans. I suspect the photo was
taken early in the morning by the stringer cited for the image, at a
time when even before the pandemic the dining halls would be pretty
empty.</p>
<p>What we see here is not a lie, not a falsehood, not even really a
bias, but the desire to tell a story. And the visual tools used to tell
the story give the reader the wrong impression. Here is what I think
might have happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>The stringer took a bunch of photos on campus, as something
newsworthy (class cancellation) had just happened. Unless the stringer
was deliberately trying to convey this message, maybe not all of the
photos had a desolate vibe. Maybe some of them even showed students
having a good time outside. The stringer sent the photos to the
Times.</li>
<li>The author or editor had to choose a photo for the article. The
article said that classes were cancelled—or, broadly, that the pandemic
was finally hitting Columbia and big changes were happening.</li>
<li>They did not want to choose a photo which would be incongruous with
the message (e.g. Columbia students outside having fun, or things being
as normal), as that would confuse the message and might require further
explanation. So they made the obvious choice: a desolate, empty dining
hall. Not being Columbia students, they may not have understood that it
portrayed an inaccurate image of the campus.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no malice or desire to skew perception in this sequence of
events (of course, it would be easy to impute a version with malice).
But the outcome is that the visuals used give the reader a false image
of reality. If I hadn’t been there that day, I might have thought
Columbia had emptied out or was under strict lockdown. That is a
journalistic failure.</p>
<p>This New York Times image is not the only example. Looking a little
more, I found this AP image from March 9 in an <a
href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/23/843329096/with-campuses-closed-columbia-and-pace-students-sue-for-damages"
rel="“nofollow”">NPR article</a>:</p>
<p><img src="npr-columbia-march9.png" /></p>
<p>The image faces north, and the popular Low Steps are completely
empty. But note the shadows and lighting which indicate that the photo
was taken early in the morning.</p>
<p>In contrast, here is an image on <a
href="https://www.instagram.com/columbiaspec/p/B9j5elWFDdi/">Instagram</a>
from the Columbia Daily Spectator, a student newspaper, taken on the
afternoon of March 9. The steps seen are the same as the steps in the
photo above:</p>
<p><img src="spectator-columbia-march9.png" /></p>
<p>Pretty big difference, yeah?</p>
<p>This makes me wonder: how many of the visuals I see in the media
offer a skewed portrayal of reality? After all, in one of the <em>very
few</em> cases where the media portrayed something I had direct
knowledge of, the portrayal was pretty skewed.</p>
<p>I invite you to take a careful look at the photos used in the media.
Look at their subjects and their composition. What message or
perspective do they convey? Do they go beyond what the article says?</p>
<h2 id="where-do-we-go-from-here">Where do we go from here?</h2>
<p>I don’t work in the media. I don’t know what incentives are at play,
have no idea what the workflow of a journalist is, and don’t know what
the editorial process looks like. But here are some baby steps which the
media can take:</p>
<ul>
<li>Appropriately contextualize information. Even the headline, which is
what most readers will see, should provide sufficient context for the
reader to accurately interpret the information (see the good examples
above). Good context in an article means giving a full quotation rather
than a snippet, or a full video rather than a soundbite.</li>
<li>Appropriately qualify a lack of knowledge, including in headlines.
Emphasize the source of information and the extent to which independent
verification was performed, especially when the source is an anonymous
government official.</li>
<li>Provide images which do not give the reader a skewed understanding,
and do not push an additional message beyond what is said in the text of
the article.</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe these points will affect the bottom-line in the short-term;
headlines and images which are less bombastic and striking will reduce
clicks and advertising revenue. And maybe the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons">tragedy of
the commons</a> is at work, with the finite, valuable, shared resource
being trust.</p>
<p>But if the media can come together and commit to better reporting,
maybe they can regain the public’s trust. If anything, they can regain
mine.</p>
